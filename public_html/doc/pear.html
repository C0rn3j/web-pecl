></H1
><P
>&#13;   PEAR is a code repository for PHP extensions and PHP library code
   inspired by TeX's CTAN and Perl's CPAN.
  </P
><P
>&#13;   The intention behind PEAR is to provide a means for library code
   authors to share their code with other developers, to give the PHP
   community an infrastructure for using third-party code, to define
   standards that help developers write code that runs in different
   PHP configurations, and to provide tools for code maintenance and
   distribution.

></H1
><P
>&#13;   This section describes some rules that are meant to make PEAR code
   available to as many users as possible.  If you plan to contribute
   to PEAR, please read this section carefully and follow these rules,
   or someone will yell at you. :-)

></H2
><P
>&#13;    Use the extension <TT
CLASS="filename"
>.php</TT
> for
    all files with PHP code (files that when included don't output
    anything, but only define variables, constants, functions or
    classes).
   </P
><P
>&#13;    A related set of one or more classes and functions in PEAR are
    called packages.  Not modules, since this term is already taken by
    Apache, and not extensions, because that is what PHP's bundled
    "modules" of C code are called.  "Packages" it is.
   </P
><P
>&#13;    The main structure in PEAR is the package structure.  Although
    this structure maps 1:1 down to the file system, it is
    conceptually not a filesystem structure.  The structure is based
    on the developer's view when writing code, which is the parameters
    to "use" or "import" (PEAR is currently using "include" though).
    An example:
    <DIV
CLASS="informalexample"
><P
></P
><P
CLASS="literallayout"
>DB<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;DB/common<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;DB/mysql<br>
HTML<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;HTML/Form<br>
</P
><P
></P
></DIV
>
    Here, the names listed are the parameters the user will give the
    "use" or "import" PHP statements.  It maps down to the filesystem
    level by adding <TT
CLASS="filename"
>.php</TT
>.  This
    means that each "top-level" node will have both a file and a
    directory in the top-level directory.  But we have an excuse for
    this: the PEAR structure is conceptually different from the
    filesystem structure, as explained above.  So there.

><P
>&#13;     Functions (not methods), should be named with underscores, like
     this: <TT
CLASS="function"
>my_function</TT
>.  Methods should be named
     with initial lower-case studlycaps like this:
     <TT
CLASS="function"
>myFunction</TT
>.

><P
>&#13;     Class names are not as straightforward.  PEAR should never have
     name conflicts among its classes (and preferably ditto for
     functions, but that can be solved using static methods in
     classes).  Since PHP doesn't have packages or name spaces yet, we
     need to "brute force" it.  The solution is currently not too
     pretty, maybe it serves as inspiration for the Zend authors to
     implement name spaces :-).
    </P
><P
>&#13;     The basic class name rule is to use the package name and
     substitute slashes with underscores.  The package "DB/mysql" has
     its code in the file "DB/mysql.php" and defines a class called
     "DB_mysql".

>&#13;    Your code should <I

>never</I
> use
    <TT
CLASS="function"
>exit</TT
> or <TT
CLASS="function"
>die</TT
> if it
    encounters an error.  This would make developers using your code
    unable to catch these errors, handle them or even display their
    own error message.  As far as possible, use some way of giving
    errors back to the caller, even if it is just a boolean return
    value.

NAME="pear-options"

></H2
><P
>&#13;    PEAR code is meant to be useable with all (reasonable)
    configurations of PHP.  Since PHP is very configurable and many of
    its features are optional, this requires extra attention from you
    as a PEAR author to make sure that your code works with different
    configurations.
   </P
><P
>&#13;    One example is the <TT
CLASS="parameter"
><I
>magic_quotes_gpc</I
></TT
> config
    option.  PEAR code should work with this option enabled or
    disabled.  Here's an example of how to properly do that:
    <DIV
CLASS="informalexample"
><P
></P
><PRE
CLASS="programlisting"
>&#13;// If magic_quotes_gpc is enabled, remove those slashes.
if (ini_get("magic_quotes_gpc")) {
    $arg = stripslashes($arg);
}

>&#13;     If you need to set some global variables in the top-level part of
     your code (outside classes and functions), it is necessary to use
     <TT
CLASS="varname"
>$GLOBALS</TT
> to make sure your variable is
     actually set in the global scope regardless of where your file is
     included from.
    </P
><P
>&#13;     It is possible, and often very useful, to include a file from
     within a function.  The included file will inherit the calling
     code's scope:

     <DIV
CLASS="example"
><P
><B
>Example 1. file1.php</B
></P
><PRE
CLASS="programlisting"
>&#13;&#60;?php $myglobal = 42; ?&#62;
</PRE
></DIV
>

     <DIV
CLASS="example"
><P
><B
>Example 2. file2.php</B
></P
><PRE
CLASS="programlisting"
>&#13;&#60;?php

class Foo {
    function Foo($arg) {
        if ($arg == 42) {
            include("file1.php");
        }
    }
}

?&#62;
</PRE
></DIV
>
    </P
><P
>&#13;     This actually sets <TT
CLASS="varname"
>$myglobal</TT
> as a local
     variable in the <TT
CLASS="classname"
>Foo</TT
> class's constructor
     function, not as a global variable.
