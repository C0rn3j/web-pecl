<h2>PEAR and Windows, a  reality</h2>
<p>
 After months of expectation, the PEAR setup&amp;management tools are now available and fully functional on Windows
 platforms. The installation script go-pear has been completely reviewed and heavily tested using the different
 Windows versions available.<br>
 In order to get all fixes/news, we strongly recommend the use of the bunlded PEAR available in the
 <a href="http://snaps.php.net">PHP4 Stable snapshots</a> (see the following paragraph).
</p>
<p>
 I (your humble servant, pierre ;) ) would like to particulary thank the following persons which made this little "miracle"
 possible, by providing new features, bugfixes or usefull tests and complete bug reports:
 <ul>
 <li>Christian Dickmann, author of PEAR_Frontend_Web and go-pear Web.</li>
 <li>Urs Gehrig, intensive Win32 tests, and bug fixes.</li>
 <li>Stig S. Bakken, last fixes/addons for unices, commits/MFH, as well as his precious advice.</li>
 <li>Edin Kadribasic, integration of the PEAR snaps scripts in the PHP snapshots system,
 tests and supports</li>
 </ul>
</p>
<h2>PEAR, PHP 4.3.2 and snapshots</h2>
<p>
 In order to allow Windows users to get the same tools as the Unix users, PEAR will be bundled back to PHP distribution,
 and this as early as the release of PHP 4.3.2. The go-pear script and every required package for the setup will be available
 in the PEAR folder of the distro; go-pear.bat launches the setup.
 <br>
 The following packages are now bundled with PHP:
 <ul>
 <li>PEAR</li>
 <li>phpUnit</li>
 <li>XML_Parser</li>
 <li>XML_RPC</li>
 <li>Archive_Tar</li>
 <li>Console_Getop</li>
 <li>DB-1.4b1</li>
 <li>Mail</li>
 <li>Net_SMTP</li>
 <li>Net_Socket</li>
 <li>Net_UserAgent_Detect</li>
 <li>PEAR_Frontend_Web</li>
 <li>HTML_Template_IT</li>
 <li>Pager</li>
 </ul>

 <br>
 In the meantime, the <a href="http://snaps.php.net">PHP 4 Stable snapshots</a> already contain PEAR.
 <br>
</p>
<h2>Go-pear, setup Web Interface</h2>
<p>
 Being still in alpha status, the PEAR installation from a web browser and the Web Frontend are bundled with PHP, too.
 A large number of users do not have any console access to their boxes or have absolutely no clue about the console
 interface, providing this kind of GUI will hopefuly be useful, as they can now install PEAR within their favourite
 browser.<br> Bugs and feature requests are welcome using the common <a href="http://bugs.php.net">bugs.php.net</a> or
 the PEAR Mailing lists.<br>
<br>
 go-pear Web usage:
 <ul>
 <li>
Download the go-pear script by using the "Save target as ..." function
of your browser at <a href="http://go-pear.org">go-pear.org</a>.</li>
<li>Place the go-pear file somewhere under the document root of your webserver.
The easiest way is to create a new directory for pear and to put the file in there.</li>
<li>Access go-pear through your webserver and follow the instructions. Please
make sure that PHP has write access to the dir you want to install PEAR into.</li>
<li>After running go-pear you get a link to the Web Frontend of the PEAR installer.
I suggest bookmarking this link.</li>
<li>Protect the Web Frontend directory and the go-pear script with a password.
Use .htaccess on Apache webservers for example.</li>
</ul>
