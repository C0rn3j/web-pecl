 It has been a moderately quiet week in the mailinglists. Consequently
 there has been more CVS traffic and more releases than usual. As a 
 time of writing total number of new PEAR releases this week is 14.
</p>
<p>
 This weeks news include details on <a href="#2">error handling</a> in
 constructors, new <a href="#3">phpDocumentor features</a>, 
 another <a href="#1">Mac OS X tutorial</a> and
 <a href="#4">seven new proposed packages</a>.

<h2>PEAR-DEV traffic</h2>

<!-- SECTION --><a name="2">
<h3>Error handling in constructors?</h3>
<p>
 There was a short discussion on what is the recommended way of handling
 errors in constructors. The answer is really simple: Even though 
 it is possible to set $this to be an instance of PEAR_Error it is 
 discouraged to use this undocumented feature. This behaviour will
 be changed in PHP5. A better aproach is to avoid all failing logic in
 constructor and use a separate method for calls which need to be 
 able to return an error. A good example of such method would be
 any factory method. 
</p>

<h3>New phpDocumentor features</h3>
<p>
 <a href="http://phpdocu.sourceforge.net/">phpDocumentor</a> 
 development team has implemented support for new 
 tags in their documentation tool. These include such tags as @source,
 @internal, @filesource, @example and @internal. For more info please
 see the <a href="http://phpdocu.sourceforge.net/Release-1.2.0beta2">release
 notes</a>.
