<h2>PEAR-DEV traffic</h2>
    
<h3>HTML_Select, a standard set of Select boxes</h3>
<p>There was continuing discussion about HTML_Select, a set of common select
menus, like countries, counties etc, And how this should work with the HTML
Package.</p>


<h3>PEAR paths in require_once, and using dirname(__FILE__)</h3>
Lukas Smith brought up the topic again of changing PEAR's require_once structure
to start using dirname(__FILE__), rather than relying on the include path
to be correctly set. This appears to be a common issue when working with Hosted
environments, and It was surmised that it may have a minor speed improvement,
as PHP would not have to search each folder in the include path before including
the file. Discussions where continuing.<br>


<h3>MDB File structure</h3>
<p>Lukas mentioned he was going to attack another item on his MDB todo list,
moving the MDB files in to the standard PEAR structure.<br>
