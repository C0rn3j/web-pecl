<h2>PEAR-DEV traffic </h2>


<h3>MDB Return by reference </h3>There was a brief discussion on how metabase
should handle return values, it appears Metabase (what MDB is based on) tended
to return values by using return by reference eg.<br>
<pre>getTextValue($bar, $bar_quoted);<br><span class="moz-txt-citetags"></span>$query = 'SELECT * from foo WHERE bar = '.$bar_quoted;<span class="moz-txt-citetags"> </span><br></pre>
However it was considered that this method was uncommon in PEAR generally.
The current standard of returning mixed, PEAR_error or the result will still
be the prefered method for returning arguments. Stig is still experimenting
with ZE2's try catch methods, and the future of returning PEAR_errors (for
ZE2 only packages) will be decided later. Meanwhile Paul Cooper has been
helping out Lukas Smith with the Postgres driver.<br>

<h3>Installer moving forward </h3>
More testing was underway to iron out bugs with the installer, especially
on Win32 platforms, the lynx piping still has issues with Win32, the current
recommended method for installing on win32 is still.<br>
<pre wrap="">c&gt; lynx -source <a class="moz-txt-link-freetext" href="http://pear.php.net/go-pear">http://pear.php.net/go-pear</a> &gt; go-pear<br>c&gt; php -d output_bufering=0 -q go-pear<br><br></pre>
<h3>Package.xml - checking consistancy </h3>
In a discussion about packaging of HTML_OOH_Forms, it was mentioned that the pear package manager can check a package.xml using<br>
<pre wrap="">pear pv</pre>
In this situation the reason for a package prolems was that the role for
a file in a package has to be one of these types = eg. &lt;file role="???"&gt;filename.x&lt;/file&gt;<br>
<pre wrap="">php ext test doc data src script</pre>
<h3>Pear and Smarty </h3>
It was asked why Smarty <a href="http://smarty.php.net">http://smarty.php.net</a>
had not become part of pear on the main pear mailing list, The reason really
revolved around the fact that nobody has really volunteered the time and
effort to pearify Smarty (and provide a BC layer). <br>
<br>
<h3>DB::Sybase </h3>
Ant&ocirc;nio Carlos Ven&acirc;ncio J&uacute;nior, has been doing bits of
work with the DB::Sybase component of the DB abstration layer and asked if
anyone was available to help test it. He has also been helping out adding
phpdoc comments.<br>
<br>
<h3>PEAR Manual and Birthdays </h3>
<a href="http://pear.php.net/wishlist.php/alexmerz">
Alexander</a> promised to try and have the new pear manual working for his birthday on the 25th (and <a href="http://pear.php.net/wishlist.php/cox">Thomas Cox's</a>
is on the 24th) - If PEAR has helped you, have a look at their wishlists.
The result of these manual fixes should mean that a more indepth documentation
can be done for each package, and the Manual Navigation should work alot
better.<br>
