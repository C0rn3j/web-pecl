<h2>New and Proposed Packages</h2>
<h3>
HTTP_Header, HTTP_Header_Cache
<br>
</h3>
Wolfram Kriesing suggested new packages which implement common
header methods and methods for handling cache headers.
<br>

<h3>
DB_Abstract
<br>
</h3>
Wolfram Kriesing also suggested a querybuilder and executer package
which is based on DB. This package has some similarities with 
DB_DataObject but is more focused on query building that dataobject
building.
<br>

<h3>
Enterprise A&A
<br>
</h3>
Tony Bibbs suggested a new Authentication & Authorization package. After
further discussion raised the possibility of merging his package and
LiveUser.
