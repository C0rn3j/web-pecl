  To celebrate the fact PEAR out of beta and as of PHP 4.3 PEAR installer 
  is included by default, Weekly News is revived again. This weeks news
  include details on voting for proposed packages, PEAR tutorial on Mac OS X,
  new phpdoc templates and missing PEAR installer from Windows binary 
  distribution. As a time of writing there has been eight new releases 
  this week. 
</p>

<h2>PEAR-DEV traffic</h2>

<h3>Who can vote?</h3>
<p>
  Interesting question arised on the list whether you need 
  a CVS account to vote for or against proposed packages or not.
  <a href="/manual/en/developers.contributing.howto.php">Instructions</a> 
  on how to contribute mentions a "developer". Since you can be a 
  developer without having a CVS account, anyone on the list can
  be qualified for voting.
</p>

<h3>PEAR on Mac OS X tutorial</h3>
<p>
  Pierre-Alain Joye spotted a nice 
  <a href="http://www.somebodydial911.com/brainstem/osx_pear/">tutorial</a> on how to setup PEAR on Mac OS X.
  The tutorial seems quite complete starting from laying the groundwork by 
  installing php cli and setting up proper enviroment variables. 
  You can also find instructions on how you can: install and use PEAR
  package manager, generate developer documentation from phpdoc and 
  last but not least how to use PEAR classes in you applications.
</p>
<p>
  The tutorial could be used as a guide for installing PEAR on traditional
  unices too the only difference being you would probably like to compile 
  the php cli from sources yourself.
</p>
<p>
 What we are still missing is a similar tutorial for Windows...
</p>

<h3>PEAR phpdoc template</h3>
<p>
  Christian Dickmann announced his <a href="http://dickmann.homeunix.org/pear/phpdoc/PEAR/">PEAR templates</a> 
  for PHPDoc are almost finished and is looking for some feedback. 
  The templates themselves look really nice. Some additional features such as
  possibility to generate docs for every released PEAR package, browser or 
  download the apidoc and upload a development release to see if looks
  fine with the layout.
</p>
<p>
  The templates are supposed to be used with 
  <a href="http://www.phpdoc.org">phpDocumentor</a>.
</p>

<h3>Windows packaging mistake</h3>
<p>
  To add some more confusion for Windows users with problems installing PEAR,
  the PEAR installer was not included in the Windows binary distribution. 
  This was not intentional and was caused by a packaging mistake. 
  This is a mistake and will hopefully be corrected in 4.3.1.
</p>


<h3>Bugs and Fixes</h3>
<p>
  Thanks to these people for spotting and fixing some bugs: 
  Lorenzo Alberton, Tobias Schlitt, Michele Manzato, Markus Wolff

<h2>New and Proposed Packages</h2>
<h3>HTTP_Header, HTTP_Header_Cache</h3>
<p>
  Wolfram Kriesing suggested new packages which implement common
  header methods and methods for handling cache headers.
</p>

<h3>DB_Abstract</h3>
<p>
  Wolfram Kriesing also suggested a querybuilder and executer package
  which is based on DB. This package has some similarities with 
  DB_DataObject but is more focused on query building that dataobject
  building.
</p>

<h3>Enterprise A&A</h3>
<p>
  Tony Bibbs suggested a new Authentication & Authorization package. After
  further discussion raised the possibility of merging his package and
  LiveUser.
</p>

<h3>GTK_VarDump</h3>
<p>
  Alan Knowles proposed a class which does a VarDump to GTK window.
