<h3>PFC, PEAR Foundation Classes RFC</h3>
<p>
  Some very good discussions has araised this week about the futur of PEAR. Christian Stocker
  wrote a very good resume in the mid-week, he started as follow:
  "The intention of PEAR Foundation Classes is to provide well-written,
  well-documentated, well-tested and well-extendable code within PEAR and
  mark them as such. For becoming a PFC, a class has to follow strict rules.
  Users of PFCs can be assured that those class went through thorough
  reviewing and testing and therefore should be the first choice for
  everyone needing a class for a given task."

<h2>New and Proposed Packages</h2>
<!-- SECTION --><a name="5"></a>
<h3>DB_ldap2 and DB_ldap3</h3>
<p>
  DB/ldap2 and DB/ldap3 are DB backends for respectively LDAP V2 and V3 databases. They implement
  the common DB interface as much as possible, but unfortunately, it is not compatible with the current
  DB_ldap. However it supports prepare/execute statements (which are powerfull) and is more flexible, as
  said the author, Piotr Roszatycki.

<h3>xsd2db conversion</h3>
<p>
 Sandro Zic did a proof of concept converting a XML schema definition to MySQL CREATE 
 TABLE statements with XSLT. A preview is available 
 <a href="http://cvs.sourceforge.net/cgi-bin/viewcvs.cgi/zzoss/zzoss/utils/xsd2db/">here</a>.
 The purposes of this package is to provide several xsd2db stylesheets for various RDMS and LDAP.
