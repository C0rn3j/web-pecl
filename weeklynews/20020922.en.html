<p>The mailing list has been very active during the past week, a sign to the
return of a active cadence of updates, adds or fixes on pear. The subjects 
were various, from the classic 'Naming convention &amp; coding standarts' 
to the automatic translation system or peardoc. Sebastian Bergmann and Kristian 
K&ouml;hntopp has work intensively on XML_Transfomer, that s make us happy 
to see a new and very good stable release.<br>
 This week has seen not less than four stable releases, that is itself a
very good news,  and one beta.   </p>

<h3>PEAR website et packages managers</h3>
 The pearweb team actually work intesivelly to fix the latest details, features 
or problems in the pear website. To help them to provide a tool as good and 
stable as possible, they need feedbacks from endusers as well as pear developers. 
If you use the pear website or one of the available packages manager, we highly
recommand to give them feedbacks about the problems you meet or your features
requests using the well known <a href="http://pear.php.net/support.php">mailing-lists</a>
or the<a href="http://bugs.php.net/"> php bugs site</a>. We thank you in
advance for your contributions.<br>
  <br>
 PS: To access the beta website, you need to activate the 'devme' cookie, 
follow this link to do it : http://pear.php.net/?devme<br>
   
<h3>MDB - Descriptions, feedbacks and contributions</h3>
 During this week, I ve seen there are many people that do not know or have 
wrong ideas of MDB goals and functionnalities. That s why I asked the author 
to shortly explain the 'what&amp;how' of the MDB package :<br>
 <br>
 ** Difference between <a
 href="http://pear.php.net/package-info.php?package=DB">PEAR DB</a> and <a
 href="http://pear.php.net/package-info.php?pacid=54">PEAR MDB</a><br>
  Both packages provide a very similar common API to all supported RDBMS
(so  PEAR DB users should feel right at home). However, PEAR MDB goes much
further  than PEAR DB in terms of RDBMS abstraction. Beyond sequence emulation
it also provides datatype abstraction (for example not all RDBMS store timestamps
 the same way) as well as index, table and database creation, altering and
 deleting. It also has RDBMS indepandant schema management. This means you
 do not have to create different sql schemas for each RDBMS you want to support.
 The MDB manager can even alter a database if the underlying schema file
has  been modified. PEAR MDB benefits from the <a
 href="http://marc.theaimsgroup.com/?l=pear-dev&amp;m=100793507904834&amp;w=2">experience</a>
 that was gained from PEAR DB development and is therefore atleast as fast
 as <a href="http://freshmeat.net/screenshots/30313/">PEAR DB</a>.<br>
  <br>
  ** Disclaimer<br>
  Currently PEAR MDB does not support as many drivers as PEAR DB does. Because
 of this and the fact that PEAR MDB is newer it should also not be considered
 to be as stable as PEAR DB. This situation should be remedied over the course
 of this fall. Please see the <a
 href="http://cvs.php.net/co.php/pear/MDB/Readme.txt?r=1.27">Readme.txt</a>
 for further details.<br>
  <br>
  Besides this note, Lukas lacks cruelly returns of experiments or feedback,
being this an essential point to arrive quickly in one stable and successful
tools. Lukas is looking for persons who want to contribute to MDB by the
creation of new drivers, at present the priority needs are SqlServer and
Oracle, you can contact Lukas Smith via the  <a
 href="http://pear.php.net/support.php">peardev</a> list or from the&nbsp;
<a href="http://pear.php.net/package-info.php?pacid=54">MDB</a>'s page.<br>
   
<h3>PEAR Documentation, japanese translation</h3>
Yasuo Ohgaki&nbsp; started this week the translation of the&nbsp; PEAR documentaion
in Japanese. We greet this usefull initiative.<br>
<h3>Pear Weekly News relayed by Nexen newsletter</h3>
Thanks to Damien Seguy to add the PEAR weelky news to the nexen newsletter.By
the way, you are free (keeping the pear copyright) to spread these news in
your lists or respective sites, for any questions, you can contact us on
the peardev mailing - list.<br>

<h3>PEAR Licence FAQ disponible</h3>
The list of recommanded licences in PEAR is now available in the <a
 href="http://pear.php.net/manual/en/faq.licenses.php">PEAR FAQ</a>.<br>
       
<h3>PHP source code beautifier</h3>
Jens Bierkandt proposed of added his(her) module of shaping of sources to
PEAR. Who has not ever 'lost' hours to reformat a code illible? This module
could be the solution, in here is the main features:<br>
<ul>
  <li>Automatic indentation of sources PHP by basing itself on a number of
given spaces</li>
  <li>New lines automatically added if needed</li>
  <li>include the options to return source corresponding to the styles C
or PEAR</li>
</ul>
It(he) should be available quickly on the cvs of pear.
<h3>Inline::C in php ?</h3>
George Schlossnagle suggested supplying the possibility of adding the well
known feature of the perl world: Inline:: C. Indeed,&nbsp; without reinventing
inevitably the wheel. The purpose being to be able to use it in this way:<br>
   
<pre>&lt;?pseudocode<br>$function_def = &lt;&lt;&lt;EOF<br>php_function(times){<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; int i,j;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; return if (zend_parse_parameters(ZEND_NUM_ARGS() TSRMLS_CC, &amp;i,&amp;j) = FAILURE)<br>	RETURN_LONG(i*j);<br>}<br>EOF<br>Inline_C($function_def);<br>times(2,2);<br>?&gt;</pre>
Inline_C would take the block of C code, adds to it the necessary information
to make a module, after compilation the binary would be put in cache and
loaded via dl ().<br>
  
<h3>Naming convention and RFC<br>
  </h3>
&nbsp;Mika Tuupola suggested to add some recommendations about the use of
names of constructors and factory ( <a
 href="http://marc.theaimsgroup.com/?l=pear-dev&amp;m=103246883300565&amp;w=2">the
thread</a>).           
<h3>I18N and translation system</h3>
Wojciech Zieli&ntilde;ski&nbsp;reminded his proposition of package of machine
translation, what raised the necessity of this type of modules. At present
Wolgang Kriesing already works on this subject via the package I18N, available
at the moment only on PEAR's cvs. If machine translations or internalisation
do parties of your goals or needs or if you wish to help them, you can contact
them via peardev.<br>
<br>
In the same manner, James E. Flemer suggested a module of a web interface
allowing to translators to create / maintain gettext catalogs (<a
 href="http://marc.theaimsgroup.com/?l=pear-dev&amp;m=103186684103620&amp;w=2">announcement</a>). 
         
<h3>Bugs and Fixes</h3>
    Merci &agrave; ces personnes pour avoir signal&eacute; des bugs et/ou 
fournit  des patches: Nigel Armstrong, Adam Morton, Rob, Richard Heyes.

<h2>New and Proposed Packages</h2>
          
<h3>Mail_Queue</h3>
 Often some actions on websites like sending many mails which could be time-consuming. 
With this class you can forgot about annoying awaiting while all these mails 
will be send via eg: smtp or qmail.<br>
 Mail_Queue performs 5 tasks:<br>
<ul>
  <li>Puts mails in temporary container waiting to be fed to MTA, put( $from, 
$recipient, $hdrs, $body ); where $hdrs and $body are in mime format.</li>
  <li>Allows define after how many seconds Mail_Queue should send each mail.</li>
  <li>Can backup or delete mails after send.</li>
  <li>Provides checking for failed delivered mails, it probes to send them
during the next session until success or a given number of iterations. On
defeat a backup each mail will be done.</li>
  <li>Allow easly sending mails in background by crontab or in over way.<br>
  </li>
</ul>
 
<h3>DB_Grid</h3>
  Yavor Shahpasov <a
 href="http://lists.php.net/article.php?group=php.pear.dev&amp;article=9202">suggested</a>
his module that provide dynamic binding betwin a database (table or sql)
and a table (html or plain text).<br>
<h3>File_Repository </h3>
Mike McCallister proposed his files repository module, taking all its importance
on big volumes of files. Indeed, we noticed that the performances of the
systems of traditional files quickly fall as soon as the quantity of files
being in the same folder is important. This module thus proposes as a viable
and very usefill alternative. The features are very interesting, you can
consult them in detail in the message of <a
 href="http://lists.php.net/article.php?group=php.pear.dev&amp;article=9226">announcement.</a><br>
            
<h3>Spread API</h3>
  George Schlossnagle suggested his intention to add his spread php interface
to PECL.&nbsp;Spread is a toolkit that provides a high performance messaging
service that is resilient to faults across external or internal networks,
further informations are available on the<a href="http://www.spread.org">
Spread website</a>. The PHP interface is currently available at : <a
 href="http://www.omniti.com/%7Egeorge/php_spread/php_spread-1.1.tar.gz">http://www.omniti.com/~george/php_spread/php_spread-1.1.tar.gz</a>.<br>
  <br>
   
<h3>Audio extension</h3>
Tony leake <a
 href="http://lists.php.net/article.php?group=php.pear.dev&amp;article=9300">suggested</a>
to add his audio extension to PECL. This will allow php to be used to write
advanced audio recording/processing apps such as multitrack recorders. In
the future I will write higher level functions to make the ecasound syntax
simpler. Furher informations are available on:&nbsp; <a
 href="http://www.webwise-data.co.uk/php_audio/php_audio_extension.html">http://www.webwise-data.co.uk/php_audio/php_audio_extension.html</a>.<br>
