<h2>Package of the week</h2>
<h3>Mono extension</h3>
<h3>Who's Sterling Hughes</h3>
<p>
  Don't ask me, 
  <a href="http://www.googlism.com/index.htm?ism=Sterling+Hughes&type=1">ask google!</a>
</p>
<h3>What is the pros/cons of publishing your work under PEAR/PECL ?</h3>
<p>
  PEAR/PECL's advantages will be different for every situation; in
  general, I see 2 big advantages:<br>
<ol>
  <li>You want an automated package distribution and management system. 
  Installing the mono extension without the pear installer requires a
  small amount of magic.  Using the pear package system, it takes me only
  a few minutes to create new releases, and for users, its a simple:i<br><br>

  $ pear install mono<br><br>

  (Note: you may use PEAR's package system outside of the PEAR framework. 
  External projects, for instance xdebug, do this.)<br><br>
  </li>
  <li> You want to publicize your library.  You not only want other
  developers to use your core, but you want reap the benefits of their
  usage: testing and debugging.  There is no better place for announcing a
  package then PEAR/PECL, which has the weight of the PHP project behind
  it.</li>
  </ol>
  As for cons - I don't see any.  Unless you want to be closed, but then,
  PEAR is not really the place for you.
</p>
<h3>What do you hope for the future of PEAR/PECL ?</h3>
<p>
  Evangelism - making PEAR the de-facto resource.  Its current
  framework/system is pretty robust; Stig and the team have done a great
  job building it, now its time to let them come.
</p>
<h3>Mono, can you describe this package and the Mono technology ?</h3>
<p>
  Mono is an open source implementation of various components in the .NET framework.  The Mono 
  extension is concerned with the Common Language Runtime (CLR) portion of Mono.  CLR is a 
  common bytecode to which all .NET languages are compiled.  Compilers are currently available
  for C#, C++, C, VB.NET, and Java.<br><br>

  CLR aims to commoditize the language syntax.  Use different languages for different 
  purposes.  If you prefer to write web frontends in PHP, but all your backend 
  code in C or C# - do so!  Previously interfacing with such code was inefficient, 
  and required either a protocol bridge, such as COM or DCOM, or writing an extension, 
  often very time consuming.  .NET is a functionality upgrade: everything is the 
  under the same hood.<br><br>

  The mono extension allows you to access .NET assemblies (called "hosting").  It 
  works much like the Java extension, using Mono to do the dirty work.  For example, 
  the quintessential Hello World, with a .NET twist:<br>
<pre CLASS="php"><code>
&lt;?php
$Console = new Mono('System.Console');
$Console-&gt;WriteLine('Hello World');
?&gt;
</code></pre>
</p>
<h3>What do you actually need from the community ?</h3>
<p>
George and I need the same thing: a billion dollars.  I, however, will
settle for lesser amounts, like a million or a couple hundred thousand.

Just use the package!  If you find bugs, or have questions drop me an
email, sterling@php.net.
</p>
<p>
Thank's to Sterling Hughes for this interview.

<h2>In the press</h2>

<h3>php|architect</h3>
<p>
 PEAR was shortly mentioned in February 2003 issue of 
 <a href="http://www.phparch.com/">php|architect</a> in
 <i>Data Fingerprinting with Hash Functions in PHP</i> written by Leon
 Vismer.

<h2>PEAR-DEV traffic</h2>

<h3>Oracle driver for MDB</h3>
<p>
 Lukas Smith announced he committed the first working Oracle 
 <a href="http://pear.php.net/package-info.php?pacid=54">MDB</a>
 driver to CVS. The driver passes all but the manager tests. 
</p>
<!-- SECTION --><a name="4"></a>
<h3>Javascript in PEAR</h3>
<p>
 There was some discussion on should PEAR have JavaScript packages.
 Consensus was PEAR should not host standalone JavaScript applications.
 Packages such as 
 <a  href="http://pear.php.net/package-info.php?pacid=77">HTML_TreeMenu</a>
 which has  optional features when JavaScript is enabled should have
 the JavaScripts included in their own package. In addition, some
 JavaScript features could be included in 
 <a href="http://pear.php.net/package-info.php?pacid=93">HTML_JavaScript</a>.
</p>

<h3>Category for Java interfaces?</h3>
 Stuart Herbert proposed a new Java category which would contain
 interfaces between PHP and Java. He states it would be better
 to contain all the interfaces in one explicit Java hierarchy than 
 scatter them all around in PEAR hierarchy. Possible place would
 be a Java subcategory under RPC top-level category. This hierarchy
 would make it easier to add interfaces for other languages such as
 Python or Ruby later.
