<h3>Oracle driver for MDB</h3>

<h3>Javascript in PEAR</h3>
<p>
 There was some discussion on should PEAR have JavaScript packages.
 Consensus was PEAR should not host standalone JavaScript applications.
 Packages such as 
 <a  href="http://pear.php.net/package-info.php?pacid=77">HTML_TreeMenu</a>
 which has  optional features when JavaScript is enabled should have
 the JavaScripts included in their own package. In addition, some
 JavaScript features could be included in 
 <a href="http://pear.php.net/package-info.php?pacid=93">HTML_JavaScript</a>.

<h3>Category for Java interfaces?</h3>
 Stuart Herbert proposed a new Java category which would contain
 interfaces between PHP and Java. He states it would be better
 to contain all the interfaces in one explicit Java hierarchy than 
 scatter them all around in PEAR hierarchy. Possible place would
 be a Java subcategory under RPC top-level category. This hierarchy
 would make it easier to add interfaces for other languages such as
 Python or Ruby later.
