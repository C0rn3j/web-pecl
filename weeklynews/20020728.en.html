Considering the summer holidays, PEAR has had another extremely busy week
with 2 stable releases, 3 beta releases, and discussions ranging from PEAR in Gentoo, new categories,
a new Manual, and a powered by PEAR icon.
 

<hr>

<h2>New Releases</h2>

<h3>Stable</h3>
Log - A framework for Logging to files, syslog,SQL and more, HTML_Table - A Package to build HTML tables

<h3>Beta</h3>
bcompiler - a php bytecode compiler (at present only for classes), PEAR_Frontend_Gtk - the desktop interface to pear's installer
(started by using pear -G, requires <a href="http://gtk.php.net">PHP-Gtk</a>), HTML_Javascript - tools for working with Javascript

<h2>PEAR-DEV traffic</h2>

<h3>PEAR and Gentoo</h3>
<p>
Gentoo have added some PEAR packages to their portage tree (their package
installation system). The list of available packages can be read at :<a href="http://www.gentoo.org/packages/dev-php/index.html">Gentoo dev-php</a>.
 

<h3>New Categories PHP, Template</h3>
<p>Following the introduction of bcompiler,
It was suggested that a new Category PHP would be useful, and could contain
packages like PHPDoc, PHPUnit, and bcompiler, as they are all packages, and
modules that deal with PHP parsing, compiling etc. It was generally accepted
that this was a reasonable idea. The other suggestion of a Template Category,
for packages like HTML_Template_IT, Template_Flexy, Template_Smart, drew
some discussion, as it was pointed out that these Template classes, (which
currently reside under HTML), could be used for other types of Files (eg.
XML, Email, RTF etc.). the current voting stood as 2-3 for and 1 against.<br>


<h3>Weekly news and HTML</h3>
<p>Most of the translators pointed out that the current 'Mozilla Generated'
HTML for the weekly news was a bit difficult to translate in Vi/emacs etc
(as it was a bit messy). Alan agreed to tidy up the HTML before committing.
More Translations have been added &nbsp;Ant&ocirc;nio Carlos Ven&acirc;ncio
J&uacute;nior (Brazilian Portuguese) and Robert Janeczek (Polish). The Weekly
news should be using the gettext extension in php (for the main titles),
however we are still awaiting confirmation from the webmaster to see if it
can be made available.

<h3>Smarty and PEAR</h3>
<p>It was agreed that for the time being <a href="http://smarty.php.net">Smarty</a>
would be made available as a PEAR package (even though it does not confirm
to the PEAR standards), and only minor changes would be made to ensure it
worked smoothly with the pear installer.

<h3>PEAR Movements </h3>
<p>Stig continued to move the non essential parts of PEAR out of the php distribution
(which will eventually only contain enough to get the pear packager up and
going). Net_SMTP, Net_Curl, Mail are now in the main pear cvs directory
(only package files will be distributed with PHP-4.3, due for QA testing
soon).

<h3>Changing Databases in DB and MDB, and ODBC cursors</h3>
<p>The question was raised about how to switch databases when using pear's Database 
abstraction layer, after some discussion the current suggestion is to use

<pre>$db-&gt;disconnect();
$db = DB::connect($new_dsn);</pre>
<p>This is the recommended way, as not all database back ends (at the php level),
can support switching databases, however anyone who wants to implement a solution
that provides switching (for databases that support it), and disconnecting
(for those that dint), is welcome to send patches. Lukas commented that he
believed MDB should handle it ok.
<p>In a related mater, Tomas indicated that he will be adding ODBC cursor support to the dsn format for example.
<pre>odbc://user:pass@ds?cursor_type=SQL_CUR_USE_ODBC</pre>


<h3>Developers Guide and PEARdoc2</h3>
<p>Martin Jansen added a new developers guide has been added to the PEAR Manual,
to help answer those developer Questions that crop up often - like
how do I write a package file and why is there is a coding standard...Meanwhile
Alexander completed his revision of the pear manual, making it more modular,
and easier to extend, expect to see a brand new manual online very soon.


<h3>DB_Pager returning constant results&nbsp;</h3>
<p>Richard Wall sent in a patch to make DB_Pager::getData() return a constant
number, as it currently followed the Google method, which was a bit confusing
for some people. It was generally agreed to make the new 'developer friendly
version' available as an extra to the current default method.

<h3>Security and Config_DB &nbsp;</h3>
<p>It was noticed by Bertand Mansion, that the Config_DB Container of the Config
package printed out the DSN (Database username,password etc.) when certain
errors occurred, this was not a particular desirable effect, and it was noted
that developers should be careful about displaying error messages with passwords
in.

<h3>Passing by reference</h3>
<p>For those not following PHP-DEV, two interesting articles where mentioned
regarding speed of&nbsp; passing by reference, - unlike C, php is actually
slower when passing (strings and integers) by reference, so be a little careful
using this feature on packages that need to be performance tuned. References
:[<a href="http://www.zend.com/zend/art/ref-count.php">http://www.zend.com/zend/art/ref-count.php</a>] and [<a href="http://phplens.com/lens/php-book/optimizing-debugging-php.php">http://phplens.com/lens/php-book/optimizing-debugging-php.php</a>]



<h3>Open office and Abiword for writing docbook</h3>
<p>It was mentioned that <a href="http://www.openoffice.org">Open office</a> was considering adding a docbook editing mode, and <a href="http://www.abiword.org">abiword</a>
could export to docbook, however neither of these are 'fully working solutions',
and at present the best bet is still emacs, vim or a text editor or <a href="http://www.softquad.com/">XMetal</a> for windows users, 
suggested reading for authors is the phpdoc how-to available at &nbsp;<a href="http://cvs.php.net/co.php/phpdoc/howto/howto.html.tar.gz">http://cvs.php.net/co.php/phpdoc/howto/howto.html.tar.gz</a> 


<h3>PEAR Snapshots</h3>
<p>It was asked if a snapshot of all pear packages could be made available.
In general, however the pear community doesn't really see the value in doing
this (due to the large size that pear will probably end up), however if somebody
wishes to make their own snapshots, they are welcome. As a result however
it was planned to add 
<pre>pear upgrade-all </pre>
<p>which would update all installed packages to the latest versions.


<h3>Powered by PEAR</h3>
<img src="http://pear.php.net/gifs/pear-power.gif" alt="powered by pear" width="88" height="31" hspace="10" align="left">
Colin Viebrock added a new powered by PEAR icon to use on your PEAR powered sites, you can download it from 
<a href="http://pear.php.net/gifs/pear-power.gif">http://pear.php.net/gifs/pear-power.gif</a>


<h3>Bugs and Fixes</h3>
<p>Thanks to Pawe&#322; Go&#322;aszewski, Matt Allen, James E. Flemer, Tal Peer and Dave Clark for spotting bugs and some fixes

<h2>Proposed Packages:</h2>


<h3>Cache_Lite - SpeedyGonzales's Caching.</h3>

<p>Marty Fabien Proposed a cut down version of the Cache class, which focused
on Performance (in a single class), NFS safety and Block Caching. After much
discussion over the naming (including suggestions like Cache_Fast, Cache_Simple,
Cache_HighTraffic, Cache_RoadRunner,&nbsp; Cache_SpeedyGonzales and&nbsp; Cache_BeepBeep),
Cache_Lite was settled on. It was noted that accelerators like Zends, PHPAcelerator
and APC would also make a considerable difference if you are going for speed/performance.
