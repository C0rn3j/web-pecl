<h2>In the press</h2>

<h3>PECL and PEAR CVS commit mails separated</h3>
<p>
 Heads up. The PECL commit messages are no longer mailed to 
 pear-cvs@lists.php.net. Instead they are now mailed to separate
 pecl-cvs@lists.php.net mailing list. It can be subsribed
 by posting a message to pecl-cvs-subscribe@lists.php.net.
</p>
<p>
 If you are only interested in PEAR commits you do not need to take
 any action.

<h3>phpdoc to peardoc2 converter</h3>
<p>
 After receiving enough support Greg Beaver announced to the list
 peardoc2 converter should be stable in phpDocumentor 1.2.0 release. 
 There will be a working "almost there" version in upcoming 1.2.0rc1
 release. This will make it easier for people to start writing peardoc2
 documentation for their classes since the converter provides pretty
 complete skeletons for the class.

<h2>New and Proposed Packages</h2>
<h3>PECL::zhat</h3>
<p>
Niels W. T. Andersen proposed his templating engine written in C which
does not break the well-formedness of an HTML/XHTML document with custom tags.
A .NET version also exists and the author is considering on implementing a 
Java version  so same templates can be used with many platforms.
</p>

<h3>Net_URL_Rewrite</h3>
<p>
Alexander Radivanovich proposed a package for rewriting urls in a similar
way with Apache mod_rewrite.
</p>

<h3>XML_Conf</h3>
<p>
Antoine Pouch proposed a package for managing constants via XML file. The 
class would read an XML file and define constants accordinly.
</p>

<h3>PHPTAL</h3>
<p>
Laurent Bédubourg proposed PHPTAL which is a PHP implementation of ZPT 
(Zope Page Templates). The implementation follows TAL/METAL/I18N 
specifications. TAL is the  Template Attribute Language originally 
developed in python by Zope community (http://www.zope.org). This template 
system has lot of fans and is implemented in python, perl, java (and now 
PHP).
</p>

<h3>DB_GoSearch</h3>
<p>
 Jon Wood proposed his DB_GoSearch package which provides a PEAR DB
 like api for accessing mnogoSearch functions.
</p>

<h3>HTTP_SimpleClient</h3>
<p>
 Alexey Borzov proposed a class which provides a more high level
 interface to HTTP than HTTP_Request. It provides higher level
 methods for GET, HEAD and POST requests and also manages cookies
 between requests.
</p>
