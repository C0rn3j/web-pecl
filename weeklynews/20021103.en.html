<p>This weeks news is brought to you live from the speakers room at the
PHP Conference in Frankfurt (which is very quite as everyone is working
on their speeches, Alexander will be giving a talk on PEAR Tommorow
(Wednesday Morning). It's been a busy conference so far, and I'll start
taking a few pictures, hopefully, of the PEAR and PHP crew who are
here. <br>
</p>
<p>This weeks on the mailing list has details of a revived Payment
Bibit package, the PEAR installer in Web format becoming available,
PEAR mentioned in relation to Yahoo (and us developers wondering if we
are going to see the Powered by PEAR logo there), and Java DataObjects
equivilant in PEAR. Along with this two new packages have been
proposed, A specialized Geneology class and another PHP extension from
George Schlossnagle, a byte code optimizer). Along with our usual list
of new releases.<br>

<h2>PEAR-DEV traffic</h2>
<h3>Payment_Bibit back to Life</h3>
Dave Mertens, who began a class to work with Bibit payment, has been
swamped with requests since he removed the incomplete class from PEAR,
he posted that he was going to try and attempt to finish it in his
spare time, as there was so much demand.<br>
<br>
<h3>go-pear goes web based</h3>

installer, that could be downloaded and installed, helping to bootstrap
the pear package manager in cases where command line access was

<h3>PEAR's mention at PHPCon (US), as Yahoo moves to PHP</h3>
PEAR got a breif mention at PHPCon in the US, during the reasoning
behind Yahoo beginning migration of alot of it's sites to PHP. While it
mentioned that PEAR does not yet compare to CPAN, all regular readers
know that the aim (when PHP4.3) is release is to provide something that
is better (in quality, if not quantity yet) than CPAN.<br>
<br>
<h3>Java DataObjects equivialent in PEAR</h3>
Andi Guntmans (of Zend Fame), posted asking about an equivilant to Java
DataObjects in PEAR. While DB_DataObjects provides some of the features
he was asking, he was keen to see a more complete implementation,
matching and exceeding the functionality of the Java Version. Watch
this space for more developments.<br>

by Zend and InCube.</p>
<h3> Genealogy_Gedcom - A specialized class for Genealogy</h3>
Olivier Vanhoucke announced a class which helps with Geneology
analysis, for those working in this field, obviously of great use.<br>
