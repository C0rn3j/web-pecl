<h3>PEAR meeting in Amsterdam</h3>
<p>
PEAR's meeting is now planed for the 9th of may, 2003 at 7:30 pm in Amsterdam.
Lukas Smith has proposed a list of subjects that can be addressed :

 <ul>
  <li>Quality vs. quantity</li>
  <li>Possible regulations to avoid some recent conflicts that took place on the ML</li>
  <li>PEAR CS (Conventions for method's names)</li>
  <li>PFC RFC</li>
  <li>PEAR Installer</li>
  <li>PEAR on windows</li>
  <li>PEARweb (voting system, comments system, packages proposal)</li>
  <li>Promoting PEAR</li>
  <li>PHP5</li>
 </ul>
  So as not to over-estimate this meeting's goals, we have already defined the
  following priorities:
 <ul>
  <li>improve the general feeling inside the PEAR community</li>
  <li>have a better idea of what PEAR should be, and the best way to achieve it</li>
  <li>brainstorming about PEAR's future</li>
 </ul>
</p>

<h3>LiveUser, a rights management and authentications package</h3>
<p>
 LiveUser provides the necessary tools to manage permissions and authentications
 in a flexible and simple way. Its container system makes it possible to have 
 different authentications and permissions sources. The integration in an existant
 system is possible by creating a specific container, permitting the developer 
 to always dispose of the same interface, no matter what the used methods are.<br>

 A lot of work was completed this week, a major update is planned for Monday, marking 
 a significant step toward a stable release.

<h3>Common methods names</h3>
<p>
 Once again, a discussion about input/output functions took place on PEAR.
 Some suggestions have received a good reception this time. It's mainly 
 about data retrieval under a specific format, for example : "toHtml" or 
 "outputHtml", corresponding respectively to retrieval and data outpur in HTML,
 the preference is tending rather towards "display" instead of "output" 
 in a webserver/browser context.

<h3>Quickform and templates system</h3>
<p>
 This week marks the beginning of work on integration of the several systems
 of templates within this form handler, making page-settings in those easier.
 Alexy Borzov has provided the base skeleton as well as the IT[X] engine
 management available within the <a href="http://pear.php.net/package-info.php?pacid=108">HTML_Template_IT package</a>, with a little advance on the functionalities.
