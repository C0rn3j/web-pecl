<h3>LiveUser,  a rights management and authentications package</h3>
<p>
LiveUser provides the necessary tools to manage permissions and authentications in a flexible and simple way. Its container system makes it possible to have different authentications and permissions sources.
The integration in an existant sytem is possible by creating a specific container, permitting to always dispose of the same interface, no matter what the used methods are.<br>
Great work was completed this week, a major update is planned for Monday, marking out a significant step towards the stable release.<br>

<h3>Common methods names</h3>
<p>
 Once again, a discussion about inputs/outputs functions took place on PEAR, some suggestions have received a good reception this time. It's mainly about data recovery under a specific format, for example : "toHtml" or "outputHtml", corresponding respectively to recovery and data printing in HTML, the preference going rather towards "display" instead of "output" in a WEB/Browser server context.

<h3>Quickform and templates system</h3>
<p>
This week marks the beggining of work on integration of the several systems of templates within this form handler, which will make page-settings of thoose easier. Alexy Borzov have provided the base skeleton as well as the IT[X] engine management available within the HTML_Template_IT package, with a little advance on the functionnalities.
