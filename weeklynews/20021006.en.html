<h2>PEAR-DEV traffic</h2>
    
<h3>Virtual File Systems</h3>
Just a short follow up to last weeks notes on Virtual File systems, Wez Ferlong
sent an email about the new streams feature in PHP4.3, which allows you to
write your own File system driver in PHP, (and use the standard PHP fopen
etc. commands) to access the file system.

<h3>Pear in PHP 4.3</h3>
As the release of PHP 4.3 draws nears, sorting out the last remaining issues
for the release are high on the priority list, at present, the two key issues
appear to be a mysterious Archive_Tar bug and final testing of the Win32 installer.
 
<h3>Branches for Zend Engine 2</h3>
Last week Sebastian Bergmann mentioned that he had branched PHPUnit for Zend
Engine 2, and talked about generally branching packages for the new Engine.
After some discussion, It was concluded that this was not the preferred method
of supporting the new Engine, rather making packages work on both engines
was better, however if it was really not possible then branching would have
to be done. 

<h3>Live User nearing release</h3>
Markus Wolff announced that LiveUser was nearing completion, thanking Christian,
Lukas and Pierre-Alain for the their help in bringing the new authentication
/ Permission Framework to this point so quickly.<br>

<h3>Some more PEAR banners</h3>
Bertrand Mansion posted a link to his PHP banner 
<img src="http://www.mamasam.com/pear_ad_2.gif" alt="pear banner" align="top">
<br>
which is available to advertise PEAR, and Colin Viebrock responded to a request
for small pear icons by adding a few more to the <a
 href="http://pear.php.net/support.php">PEAR support page.</a> Available
as Gifs and Pngs<br>
for Pear <img src="http://pear.php.net/gifs/pear-icon.gif"> and PECL <img

<h3>Bugs and Fixes</h3>
  Thanks to these people for spotting bugs and sending fixes: Francisco Benza,
Jason Rust, phpsurf, Pawe&#322; Go&#322;aszewski and Urs Gehrig

<h2>New and Proposed Packages</h2>
    
<h3>Message for hash calculations and HMAC signatures.</h3>
Jesus Castagnetto announced a package to create hashes using the common PHP
hash functions, normally used to verify data messages. 

<h3>Net_Auth_SASL</h3>
Richard Heyes announced a package to implement SASL encryption to communicate
over sockets, this could then be used in common clear text protocols (eg.
SMTP, IMAP and Sieve) to improve security.
