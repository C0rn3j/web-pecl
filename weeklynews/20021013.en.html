<p>
Alan Knowles family forces him to stay away from computers for some days ;-)<br>
I hope, i can write the weekly news in the same quality like he did.<br>
A brief digest: the dominating topic was LiveUser, Stig registered new PEAR related domain names and PEAR&amp;privacy.

<h2>PEAR-DEV traffic</h2>

<h3>Category Perm?</h3>
<p>Markus Wolff asked for a new category called Perm for LiveUser. There was no agreement and Markus released LiveUser under the category Authentication.</p>

<h3>Go PEAR, go!</h3>
<p>Stig Bakken registered the web domains <a href="http://go-pear.org" target="_blank">go-pear.org</a>|.com|.net. They serve the go-pear script, which installs a current working PEAR base system including the PEAR installer. If you want a working PEAR on your system just run on your prompt:<br>
<pre>lynx -source go-pear.org|php</pre></p>

<h3>PEAR&amp;Privacy</h3>
<p>Derick Rethans noted some possible privacy problems on the PEAR web. If you download a package, your IP will be stored for statistical reasons. This could hurd laws in some european countries. There was no decision how to handle this - we are programmer, not lawyers. If you more know then we, then wrote a note to the PEAR-Dev mailing list.</p>
