<h3>Ready made binaries and Package Signing </h3>
Following some discussion on IRC, &nbsp;Marko Karppinen Posted the plans
for distributing binaires of PECL (php extensions). Following the recent
OpenSSH incident where somebody put malicous code in a source distribution,
there is obviously a heightend need for additional security and checks here.
For more details on the proposal please read the post <a
 href="http://marc.theaimsgroup.com/?l=pear-dev&amp;m=102769689219883&amp;w=2">here</a>
<h3>Making Documentation easier</h3>
Currently underway and under consideration are 3 projects to try and make
writing documentation PEAR easier. <br>
<ul>
  <li>HTML to Docbook, Martin Jansen proposed a very simple mapping of HTML
type &lt;H1&gt; type tags to docbook - see the notes <a
 href="http://marc.theaimsgroup.com/?l=pear-dev&amp;m=102770762000379&amp;w=2">here</a></li>
  <li>Phpdoc to Docbook, Alexander and Alan both mentioned this - Alans approach
was to extend the PHP_Codedoc tool that he had written to do this.</li>
  <li>OpenOffice to Docbook,&nbsp; Wolfram Kriesing was considering writing
a convertor for openoffice XML -&gt; docbook</li>
</ul>
<h3>Package Statistics Improved </h3>
Tal Peer, added a <a href="http://pear.php.net/package-stats.php">full summary</a>
for the package statistics, so you can see a list of how many times all the
packages has been downloaded.&nbsp;
<h3>High Speed file access. </h3>
After a brief dicussion about performance and file reading, Thomas Cox posted
a&nbsp; <a
 href="http://marc.theaimsgroup.com/?l=pear-dev&amp;m=102819831726965&amp;w=2">quick
benchmark</a> &nbsp;illustrating fread() being noticably faster than implode('',file())<br>
<br>
<h3>new PECL extenstion - PICOSQL </h3>
Bindings for the <a href="http://www.picosoft.it/picosql/index.html">picosql</a>
database have been added to PECL, picosql is a proprietary relational database
that has 'brought out into the open', with a LGPL licence.<br>
<h3>new PECL extenstion - python </h3>
John Praise Added his python extension to PECL, enabling you to mix Python
and PHP, and access Python variables from php.<br>
<br>
<h3>PHPDoc back to life </h3>
The <a href="http://www.ActiveState.com/ActiveAwards2002">Award Winning</a>
Derick Rethans has picked up the gauntlet of fixing up PHPdoc, and is looking
for suggestions about what could be added to it.<br>
<br>
<h3>Bugs and Fixes </h3>
