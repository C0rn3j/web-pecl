<p>After Last weeks hectic activity, this week calmed down with only 2 Stable
and 2 Beta Releases, along with continuing discussion on making documentation
as easy as possible, New Package Statistics, Signed Binary releases, PHPDoc
back to life and 2 New C extensions in PECL.<br>
</p>
<hr>


<h2>New Releases</h2>

<h3>Stable</h3>
<b>Science_Chemistry</b> - Classes to represent &nbsp;Atoms, Molecules and Macromolecules, 
<b>HTML_Javascript -</b> for working with Javascript

<h3>Beta</h3>
<b>Math_Vector</b> - For doing 2D and 3d vector Maths, 
<b>MDB</b> - the Metabase database Abstraction layer PEAR port.

<h2>PEAR-DEV traffic </h2>

<h3>Ready made binaries and Package Signing </h3>

Following some discussion on IRC,  Marko Karppinen Posted the plans
for distributing binaries of PECL (php extensions). Following the recent
OpenSSH incident where somebody put malicious code in a source distribution,
there is obviously a heightened need for additional security and checks here.
For more details on the proposal please read the post <a
 href="http://marc.theaimsgroup.com/?l=pear-dev&m=102769689219883&w=2">here</a>

<h3>Making Documentation easier</h3>
Currently underway and under consideration are 3 projects to try and make
writing documentation PEAR easier. <br>
<ul>
  <li>HTML to Docbook, Martin Jansen proposed a very simple mapping of HTML
type &lt;H1&gt; type tags to docbook - see the notes <a
 href="http://marc.theaimsgroup.com/?l=pear-dev&m=102770762000379&w=2">here</a></li>
  <li>Phpdoc to Docbook, Alexander and Alan both mentioned this - Alan's approach 
     was to extend the PHP_Codedoc tool that he had written to do this.
     Alexander will write an Docbook renderer for PHPDoc itself, the output
     should be directly insertable into the PEAR Manual</li>
  <li>OpenOffice to Docbook,&nbsp; Wolfram Kriesing was considering writing
      a converter for openoffice XML -&gt; docbook</li>
</ul>

<h3>Package Statistics Improved </h3>
Tal Peer, added a <a href="http://pear.php.net/package-stats.php">full summary</a>
for the package statistics, so you can see a list of how many times all the
packages has been downloaded.

<h3>High Speed file access.</h3>
After a brief discussion about performance and file reading, Tomas Cox posted
a <a  href="http://marc.theaimsgroup.com/?l=pear-dev&m=102819831726965&w=2">quick
benchmark</a>  illustrating fread() being noticeably faster than implode('',file()).

<h3>PHPDoc back to life </h3>
The <a href="http://www.ActiveState.com/ActiveAwards2002">Award Winning</a>
Derick Rethans has picked up the gauntlet of fixing up PHPdoc, and is looking
for suggestions about what could be added to it.

<h3>Bugs and Fixes </h3>
Thanks to these people for spotting and fixing some bugs, Pawe&#322; Go&#322;aszewski,
Thomas Schulz, James Flemer, Peter Bowen
