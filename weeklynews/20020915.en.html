<h2>PEAR-DEV traffic</h2>
    
<h3>PEAR Licence FAQ</h3>
  Rasmus Lerdof announced that he was adding a more comprehensive list of 
licences for PEAR packages, based on a request by Richard Stallman. These 
are OSI (Open Source Institute)&nbsp; and FSF (Free Software Foundation) approved
licenses. They should appear in the manual soon.    
<h3>PEAR Config new Parsers</h3>
 Bertrand Mansion announced he had revamped the Config class, added a number 
of new backend parsers and changed the current ones. This does break backwards 
compatibility, so if you rely on the old version you will have to make sure 
you tell the pear installer which version you require.    
<h3>MDB manager abstract</h3>
  Lukas posted a <a
 href="http://lists.php.net/article.php?group=php.pear.dev&amp;article=8951">summary</a>
 of the MDB manager layer, which helps explain some of the differences and
 advantages of moving to MDB, the Metabase PEAR merger project, he has also
 been working on some documentation that will help anyone wishing to write
 a backend driver for MDB.    
<h3>Tomas V. Cox away for the next few weeks</h3>
  Tomas Cox, one of the core developers behind PEAR, announced he will a
little  busy in the next few weeks. A few jokes followed about slipping stuff
in while he's away..    
<h3>Phpdoc2peardoc</h3>
  Alexander Merz <a
 href="http://lists.php.net/article.php?group=php.pear.dev&amp;article=9004">announced</a>
 the first version of a tool to convert phpdoc comments in the source into
 peardoc (for the pear manual), it involves a small amount of changes to
phpdoc,  but is a great step forward to improving the usablility of PEAR
packages.    
<h3>Getting PEAR to work outside the PEAR tree.</h3>
  Peter Schoenster, while attempting to install DB_DataObjects, brought up
 the issue of how to install pear packages outside of the default pear tree,
 quite a common requirement when working on hosted servers. a number of options
 are available for this.   
<pre>pear config-set php_dir /where/i/want/pear</pre>
  will change the installation target directory for the current user,<br>
<br>
Download the needed packages and untar the files in a folder available in
your include_path.<br>
To set up your include path, you can  use&nbsp;<code>ini_set('include_path','/where/i/put/pear');</code>,
this command should be added by an auto_prepend script, or simply in a common
config file you include in each pages (require_once 'config.inc.php', by
example)<br>
Use a .htaccess file with&nbsp; <code>php_value include_path /where/i/put/pear</code>
