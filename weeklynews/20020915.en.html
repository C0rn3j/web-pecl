<h2>PEAR-DEV traffic</h2>

<h3>PEAR Licence FAQ</h3>Rasmus Lerdof announced that he was adding a more
comprehensive list of licences for PEAR packages, based on a request by Richard
Stallman. These are OSI (Open Source Institute)&nbsp; and FSF (Free Software
Foundation) approved licenses. They should appear in the manual soon. <h3>PEAR Config new Parsers</h3>Bertrand Mansion announced he had added
revamped the Config class and added a number of new backend parsers, and
changed the current ones, this does break backwards compatibility, so if
you rely on the old version you will have to make sure you tell the pear
installer which version you require. <h3>MDB manager abstract</h3>Lucus posted a <a href="http://lists.php.net/article.php?group=php.pear.dev&amp;article=8951">summary</a>
of the MDB manager layer, which helps explain some of the differences and
advantages of moving to MDB, the Metabase PEAR merger project, he has also
been working on some documentation that will help anyone wishing to write
a backend driver for MDB. 
<h3>Tomas Cox away</h3>
Tomas Cox, one of the core developers behind PEAR, announced he will a little
busy in the next few weeks. A few jokes followed about slipping stuff in
while he's away.. <br>
<h3>Phpdoc2peardoc</h3>
Alexander Merz <a href="http://lists.php.net/article.php?group=php.pear.dev&amp;article=9004">announced</a>
the first version of a tool to convert phpdoc comments in the source into
peardoc (for the pear manual), it involves a small amount of changes to phpdoc,
but is a great step forward to improving the usablility of PEAR packages.
<h3>Getting PEAR to work outside the PEAR tree.</h3>
Peter Schoenster, while attempting to install DB_DataObjects, brought up
the issue of how to install pear packages outside of the default pear tree,
quite a common requirement when working on hosted servers. a number of options
are available for this.<br>
<br>
<pre>pear config-set php_dir /where/i/want/pear<br></pre>
will change the installation target directory for the current user, or you
can just download and untar the file. To set up your include path, you can
use&nbsp;<code>ini_set('include_path','/where/i/put/pear');</code> or use a .htaccess file with&nbsp; <code>php_value include_path /where/i/put/pear</code><h3>Bugs and Fixes</h3>
Thanks to these people for spotting bugs and sending fixes: Pawe&#322; Go&#322;aszewski, Michael Dransfield, Jeremy Pointer, Alexy Borzov.<hr>

server, the package includes and example file based Webdav Server.
