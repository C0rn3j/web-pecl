 It has been a relatively busy week in PEAR land with nine new releases 
 out of which two are totally new packages. Total number of packages
 is now 151. The largest category is Networking with 27 
 packages. Networking is followed by HTML with 15 entries and Database 
 with 11 entries. Despite the numbers presented in here it is good
 to remember quality is still preferred over quantity.

<h2>PEAR-DEV traffic</h2>

<h3>PEAR DB and MDB development</h3>
<p>
 Lukas Smith raised his concern on uncertainty about how feature
 additions to PEAR DB should be handled in MDB. If MDB was to become 
 the standard abstaction layer in PEAR it has to maintain full
 backwards compatibility with DB. If not, there would be more
 freedom in developing MDB. There is still no clear answer on
 what will be the final relation between DB and MDB 
 and should MDB replace DB at some point or should their development
 continue on separate paths.

<h3>Maintaining high quality</h3>
<p>
 On another mail Lukas also pointed out that it is currently
 very hard to follow what packages are being proposed, accepted 
 and for what reasons. In addition to that it seems we have been
 lowering our expectations and not all packages are such high
 quality.
</p>
<p>
 As a solution to package proposal and approval problem the old idea
 of having a "New Package Proposal" section in PEAR website was
 brouht up again. New packages would be proposed and voted via this
 section. The current system works now, but there might be problems
 in the future when more developers join in.
</p>
<p>
 About the quality issue it is up to PEAR developers to decide
 whether we prefer quality over quantity or vice versa.

<h2>New and Proposed Packages</h2>
<!-- SECTION --><a name="5"></a>
<h3>HTML_PageHandler</h3>
<p>
 Wolfram Kriesing proposed his HTML_PageHandler class which
 handles common tasks that occur when handling forms. The class
 wraps underlying class such as DB_QueryTool and calls its methods
 when an event such as saving, removing or editing data occurs.
</p>
<!-- SECTION --><a name="6"></a>
<h3>HTTP_Session</h3>
<p>
 Alexander Radivanovich proposed his HTTP_Session class which is
 an wrapper around native PHP session handling mechanisms also 
 providing an object oriented API and database storage of sessions
 via PEAR DB. At the time of writing first release has allready
 been made.
</p>

<h3>Net_IMAP</h3>

 Damian Alejandro Fernandez Sosa is developing an userland
 implementation of IMAP protocol which provides IMAP access
 to people that dont have IMAP support compiled. The class
 also implemets some features native imap functions do not
 provide.
