After a weeks break due to jetlag from the PHP Conference, this weeks
news covers all the events from both weeks. It was a pretty busy few
weeks for discussions on the mailing list, and A considerable amount of
new packages where proposed, taking PEAR closer to the point where it is
larger than CPAN.... &nbsp;I've left out the Release summary, as this
is really available at the end of the News, and have focused more on
news from the list and a quick summary of all these new packages.
