<h3>DB::Sybase - Sybase Drivers for the DB abstraction layer </h3>Anotonio Carlos Venancio Junior popped up to volunteer to write the sybase backend for the DB abstraction layer.<h3>DB_DBA - The Berkley DB wrapper </h3>Brent
Cook is finishing off the DBA (Berkley DB) interface layer that includes
alot of tools for making Flat file DBA's look a bit like SQL databases, <br>

<h3>Zend Engine 2 and Errors </h3>Two things came up about the move towards
PHP5 and Zend Engine 2, the new catch throw error reporting and the new reserved
keyword 'delete', Stig has been testing ZE2 and the new raiseError method
look like it will be simplified considerably....., On the delete front, It
was noticed that DB_DBA and DB_DataObject both used delete methods, this
would break in PHP5. Brent changed the delete method to remove in DB_DBA,
Alan meanwhile started a brief discussion with Andi to see if delete could
be allowed as a class method..<br>

<h3>Miscelaneos fixes </h3>Mail_Mime licence in the package file was fixed, Dan Allen fix a small bug with File_CSV.<br>
<h3>Licences </h3>Brent Cook posted an interesting article on why he chose
to use the LGPL, rather than the PHP Licence for the DB_DBA package, if you
are looking at the licence for your package, it's an <a href="http://lists.php.net/article.php?group=php.pear.cvs&amp;article=4936">interesting analysis</a>. <br>
