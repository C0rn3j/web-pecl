<H3>User Authenticaiton </H3>

A common theme returned in the form of an API for user registration and authenticatoin, while this has been discussed before, the general consensus was that it would be difficult to produce a generic API that would suit all applicaitons . However there is alot of interesting reference material in the discussion, and pointers to developing something around LDAP or similar.

<H3>Pear Packages </H3>

Alexander brought up the idea for distributing applications using the pear package manager, didnt recieve much response, but it is something that has been discussed on #pear, and all the members involved in the package manager are keen to see it happen, as soon as the packager is working reliably on windows and unix for the current PEAR packages

<H3>Caching On XMLRPC </H3>

To improve the performance of the installers Christian Dickmann has been adding a small simple caching layer to the pear xmlrpc site.

<H3>Pear Log and Windows/Unix differences </H3>

After a few experiments it was discovered that Windows and Unix have different Syslog error codes, which affected the PEAR:Log class, the intention was to stop using the system defines, and use a PEAR_LOG_* set.
