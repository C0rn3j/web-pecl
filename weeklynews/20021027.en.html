<p>Another Quiet week, as a number of the PEAR developers are preparing for
the forthcomming PHP conference in Frankfurt (come and see the warm bodies
behind all that code). Discussion on the dirname(__FILE__) issue continued,
with the original Architect explaining the reasoning behind the design decision.

<h2>PEAR-DEV traffic</h2>
    
<h3>PEAR paths in require_once, and using dirname(__FILE__) continued</h3>
Following last weeks discussion on using dirname(__FILE__) for paths, Stig
Bakken pointed out the serious problems of using this in conjunction with
multiple PEAR installations (eg. a global + user one). The problem being that
require_once, would become seriously confused and may end up loading 2 classes
with the same name from 2 different files, hence causing a conflict. The
current method of letting the include path sort this out is the only currently
viable solution.



<h3>new MDB Containers for PEAR cache and mail queue</h3>
<p>Lorenzon Alberton announced he had written MDB containers for PEAR cache
and mail queue. </p>


<h3>User notes for the PEAR manual</h3>
It was suggested by Jon Wood, that one of the most popular feature of the
PHP manual be added to the PEAR manual, although there weren't many responses,
It is likely that when peardoc2 goes live, this will be a key feature that
will be added.


<h3>Bugs and Fixes</h3>
Thanks to these people for spotting and fixing some bugs, David Viner, Daniel
C, Lorenzo Alberton, Sebastian R&ouml;bke, Mika Tuupola, Alan Richmond, Robin
Ericsson,

<h2>New and Proposed Packages</h2>
    
<h3>APC  - Advanced PHP cache now in PECL</h3>
<p>George Schlossnagle announced his intention to add APC, a freely available
PHP cache to PECL.<br>
</p>


<h3>ezSQL - a simplified Database API</h3>
<p>Justin Vncent Proposed his simplified Database API for PEAR, after some
confusion about how it would fit into PEAR, a general consensus that this
kind of wrapper as an extension to DB or MDB may be of some use to some users.
Although the purists amount the pear developers where not that keen on the
over-hiding of the database connection details. <br>
</p>


<h3>Net_Cyrus - an interface to the Cyrus IMAP server managment commands.</h3>
Richard Heyes Proposed a Package to provide an interface to the Cyrus IMAP
mail server, enabling the adding users, and changing  their Access rights.
