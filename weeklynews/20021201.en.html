<h2>PEAR-DEV traffic</h2>
<h3>Contributing to PEAR and License implications<br>
</h3>
There was considerable discussion in the last couple of weeks about
including GPL'ed code in PEAR, while most developers are not keen on an
outright ban, the implications of having a code library that affects
applications that use it is significant, and the general consensus was
that when contributing authors will be asked if they can change to the
slightly more library (and more suited to libraries) LGPL license.
However for PECL libraries, it is likely that accepting GP code will be
impossible due to the linking requirements and incompatibility with the
PHP license.
<h3>PHP Documenter now available from&nbsp; PEAR</h3>
After a few efforts Greg Beaver finally got the package format sorted
out, and has made available PHP Documenter available via the pear
installer.<br>
<h3>New Release of PEAR web installer<br>
</h3>
Christian Dickmann announced another release of his easy to use Web
based pear installer, ideal for those using hosted solutions or just too
lazy to learn the command line options. You can download it and read
the instructions at<br>

<h3>New Imagemagick bindings to replace the current PECL::imagick<br>
</h3>
Michael Montero announced a totally new binding for the imagemagick
toolkit, after some discussion it was decided that it will replace the
existing PECL::imagick by Christian Stocker. The new bindings offer a
number of new features, however break Backwards compatibility with the
previous extension. There are also plans underway to make a Object based
API available as an alternative to the current classic php functional
