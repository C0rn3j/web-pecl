<h3>PHP-Magazin</h3>
<p>
 The 1 / 2003 issue of <a href="http://www.phpmag.de/">PHP-Magazin</a>
 has many well written articles about PEAR. Alexander Merz wrote a
 nice PEAR resume. He also wrote a useful introduction on how to 
 setup, administrate and use PEAR. Hartmut Holzgraefe shows us how
 to use the PEAR::HTTP_WebDAV_Server. Richard Samar introduces XML
 databases XPath and  XQuery. He also writes about using PEAR::XDB modules, 
 especially the Tamino driver.

<h2>PEAR-DEV traffic</h2>

<!-- might add this later 

<h3>CS changes for PHP5?</h3>
<p>
</p>

-->

<h3>DB_DOM ready for CVS</h3>
<p>
 Sandro Zic notified the pear-dev list that the code has gone under
 pearification. The DOM-like management of XML content in a defined RDBMS table 
 structure  package has already been approved on the list and is ready 
 to be committed into CVS.
 Unfortunately no agreement was reached on the package name, feedback
 is most appreciated.
</p>
<p>
 Proposed names include: DB_DOM, DB_XML, DB_XML_DOM, XML_DB
 and XML_DB_DOM. Feel free to send your ideas to the <a href="mailto:pear-dev@lists.php.net">list</a>.
</p>
 
<h3>PEAR Foundation?</h3>
<p>
  There was some discussion on whether there should be be a 
  foundation for sponsoring PEAR development or not. There are 
  similar foundations sponsoring big projects such as FreeBSD and Perl. 
  However, PEAR is still in the small league of open source projects
  and a foundation would be a bit of an overkill. The current per-developer
  wishlist style approach should be adequate.
</p>

<h3>Bugs and Fixes</h3>
<p>
  Thanks to these people for spotting and fixing some bugs: 
  Warren Konkel, Demian Turner, Patrick O'Lone, Jeroen Houben,
  Vlad Borisoff and Blake Schwendima.

<h2>New and Proposed Packages</h2>

<h3>Net_LMTP</h3>
<p>
 Damian Alejandro Fernandez Sosa suggested a class which is cabable of
 delivering email via LMTP (Local Mail Transfer Protocol, defined in <a href="http://www.faqs.org/rfcs/rfc2033.html">RFC 2033</a>).
 The proposed name was Net_LMTP which serves the purpose perfectly.
 Net_LMTP is based upon Net_SMTP.
