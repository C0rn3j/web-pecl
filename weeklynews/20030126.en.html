<h2>PEAR-DEV traffic</h2>

<!-- might add this later 

<h3>CS changes for PHP5?</h3>
<p>
</p>

<h3>DB_DOM ready for CVS</h3>
<p>
 Sandro Zic notified their allready pear-dev approved class for
 DOM-like management of XML content in a defined RDBMS table 
 structure has been pearified and is ready to be committed into CVS.
 Unfortunately they haven't decided the final name yet and are waiting
 for feedback. 
</p>
<p>
 Some proposed names were: DB_DOM, DB_XML, DB_XML_DOM, XML_DB
 and XML_DB_DOM.
</p>
 
<h3>PEAR Foundation?</h3>
<p>
  There was some discussion on whether there should be be a 
  foundation for sponsoring PEAR development or not. There are 
  similar foundations sponsoring big projects such as FreeBSD and Perl. 
  However, PEAR is still in the small league of open source projects
  and a foundation would be a bit of an overkill. The current per-developer
  wishlist style approach should be adequate.
</p>

<h3>Bugs and Fixes</h3>
<p>
  Thanks to these people for spotting and fixing some bugs: 
  Warren Konkel, Demian Turner, Patrick O'Lone, Jeroen Houben,
  Vlad Borisoff and Blake Schwendima.

<h2>New and Proposed Packages</h2>

<h3>Net_LMTP</h3>

 delivering email via LMTP (Local Mail Transfer Protocol, defined in <a href="http://www.faqs.org/rfcs/rfc2033.html">RFC 2033</a>).
