<h3>PHP doc tag standards</h3>

<p>Ant&ocirc;nio Carlos Ven&acirc;ncio J&uacute;nior asked about
the standards for PHPDoc tags (the tags inside the PHP classes that
help produce automated documentation), having reviewed the current
range of uses in pear, Ant&ocirc;nio offered to write a clear quick
reference for the PEAR site, at present you can find the list of
standard tags and formats a</p>

</pre>

<h3>ISO-8601 in Date</h3>

<p>To integrate better with the SOAP module, Baba Buehler added ISO
8601 to the format() method of the Date class. You can use it by
with the following syntax.</p>

<pre>%o - gives the raw timezone offset in &plusmn;hh:mm<br>%O - gives the dst-corrected offset in &plusmn;hh:mm<br>eg.<br>Date::format("%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%S%O");<br></pre>

<h3>OpenOffice to Docbook, and more progress on Automating the
documentation</h3>

<p>Pierre-Alain Joye has been busy making a Open office to Docbook
converter, along with a method for converting Microsoft word 'save
as HTML' output into Docbook. you can try out the current
version at</p>

<pre><a href="http://www.pearfr.org/docconvert/Doc_Convert-0.1.tgz">http://www.pearfr.org/docconvert/Doc_Convert-0.1.tgz</a>
</pre>

<p>There was continuing discussion of adding support to PHPDoc to
generate Docbook from the comments, and Alan Knowles <a href="http://marc.theaimsgroup.com/?l=pear-dev&amp;m=102946826409440&amp;w=2">
posted</a> his first effort at doing this using his PHP_CodeDoc
tool, Noting that the task is not as simple as it appears to
be....</p>

<h3>Bulk emailing</h3>

<p>Radek Maciaszek mentioned he was working on a class to do mail
queue management for sending large quantities of email, he was
going to send it to Richard Heyes to review it after adding a few
comments.</p>

<h3>PHPUnit, being too acurate</h3>

<p>Wolfram Kreising was testing PHPUnit and discovered that it was
being far too strict for a loosely typed language, eg. failing when
comparing "1" == 1 within arrays. He was still looking for ideas on
how to solve this.</p>

<h3>Permissions Managment</h3>

<p>Always a topic of much interest to all developers is that of a
coherent Authentication, Authorization, Permissions and Users
mechanism. This got one step closer as there was considerable of
discussion over the LiveUser Package that Marcus Wolff has been
working on. This looks like it will provide a flexible standard
API, that would enable back ends for a variety of applications to
accessed using a single API. Enabling you to integrate bulletin
board or forum packages within your applications without having to
modifying code to suit each application.</p>

<p>The only remaining matter was how to integrate this into the PEAR
class naming structure, Suggestions that got better reviews where
along the lines of Auth_LiveUser, Perm_LiveUser. The use of a top
level category combined with a more distinct name 'LiveUser' was
prefered over a more generic name like Auth_Simple or
Auth_Complex.</p>

<p>On a side issue to this, it may be worth researching some of the
discussion on php-dev recently that has dealt with the security
issues behind sessions, both trans-sid, cookees and HTTP in general
(another topic of heated debate, but eventually ending with
intelligent suggestions). Hopefully a full summary will be
available in the php manual soon.</p>

<h3>Net_Whois, a whole new feature set</h3>

<p>Seamus Venasse had built a new Net_Whois, and wondered how to
deal with competitive classes in PEAR, since his Whois package
offered a richer set of features, than the current one. After some
discussion it became clear that just merging the existing
funcitonality and API into his and replacing the old Net_Whois
would be a far better solution. The final decision on this did rest
with Sebastian Nohn (the current maintainer of Net_Whois).</p>

<h3>Bugs and Fixes</h3>

<p>Thanks to these people for spotting
and fixing some bugs, Radek Maciaszek, Arnaud Limbourg, Tim White
and Roman Neuhauser</p>

<h2>New and Proposed Packages</h2>

<h3>Math_Distance, measuring distances between multiple
locations</h3>

<p>Alfredo offered a package to
calculate distances, between multiple points, this can use multiple
mathematical functions to do the calculations.<br>
