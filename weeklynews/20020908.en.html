<h3>Common Naming of methods</h3>
Following the release of HTML_Template_IT, Marcus Wolff brought up the idea
of starting to document, and produce guidelines for more common methods within
PEAR, methods like&nbsp; getHTML(), toString() where common requirements.
Obviously a balance has to be found here, between breaking Backwards compatibility
on existing classes and improving the general PEAR API,&nbsp; making it easy
to use for all users.<h3>APD focusing on profiling</h3>George Schlossnagle,
followed up with his addition of APD, the advanced php debugger, with discussion
surrounding it new focus on profiling, and removing the original tracing
functions, which where not really that usefull in comparison to the new profilling
code. The new code is available in the 'execute_wrapper' branch.<br>

merger release candidate, he has been focusing on on the XML schema parser,

would be very usefull. <h3>MDB_Frontend, a phpmyadmin type interface using MDB</h3>Christian Dickmann

type interface to databases utilizing the new MDB abstraction layer, this
was warmly recieved, after a bit of nudging by Christian. <h3>Net_Ident, for getting ident data from a socket</h3>Ondrej Jombik proposed a Net_Ident class, based on the work by Gavin Brown
