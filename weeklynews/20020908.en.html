<p>This week see the number of PEAR packages hit 85, with Richard Stallman acknowledging that the latest version of the 
PHP license is far more FSF friendly and helping suggest licenses for PEAR. PEAR continue to grow with PHP offering an unrivaled 
range of quality code libraries. Another busy week with a steady flow of releases, 2 Stable, 2 Beta, 1 Alpha and 1 development. 
More discussion on standards, and the move towards having method naming guidelines. APD starts focusing on profiling 
and MDB moves to release candidate #3. Along with a continuing stream of new packages with 5 proposed this week.

<h2>PEAR-DEV traffic</h2>

<h3>Common Naming of methods</h3>
Following the release of HTML_Template_IT, Marcus Wolff brought up the idea
of starting to document, and produce guidelines for more common methods within
PEAR, methods like getHTML(), toString() where common requirements.
Obviously a balance has to be found here, between breaking Backwards compatibility
on existing classes and improving the general PEAR API, making it easy
to use for all users.

<h3>APD focusing on profiling</h3>
George Schlossnagle,
followed up with his addition of APD, the advanced PHP debugger, with discussion
surrounding it new focus on profiling, and removing the original tracing
functions, which where not really that useful in comparison to the new profiling
code. The new code is available in the 'execute_wrapper' branch.

<h3>MDB moves to Release Candidate #3</h3>
Lukas Smith announced another MDB, the Metabase, pear database abstraction
merger release candidate, he has been focusing on on the XML schema parser,
along with fixes relating the the new MDB_Frontend Package. A lively conversation
ensued this release, focusing on issues of making more drivers available,
If you want to help out write MDB drivers for Oracle, MSSQL or any others,
please contact Lukas on the mailing list.

Richard Heyes Proposed a new package for displaying table like info on 
the terminal, and intended to continue work adding colour highlighting in bash.

<h3>Text_Password - for making pronounceable passwords </h3>

After some discussion, it was generally agreed that a more general Text_Password,
which included this feature and possibly a non-pronounceable password generator
would be very useful.

Christian Dickmann proposed a new Package MDB_Frontend, designed to provide a Web based phpMyAdmin
type interface to databases utilizing the new MDB abstraction layer, this
was warmly received, after a bit of nudging by Christian.
