Some use cases for the PEAR web site.  These describe a typical
scenario and its work flow.

PEAR glossary:

Package: A software project released through PEAR.  A package has one
or more maintainers, its own release history and so on.  Packages
are named by topic, using underscores to separate each level, for
example "XML_RPC" or "HTML_Form".

Package Hierarchy: (also "PEAR tree") The name structure that is
reflected in PEAR's install directory.

Virtual Package: An "empty" package that exists only to make room for
sub-packages.  A virtual package has one or more maintainers who are
responsible for that branch of the package hierarchy.

Namespaces: Think of namespaces as "directories" for symbol names.
They are typically used to avoid name clashes.  Namespaces don't exist
in PHP today, so PEAR uses a naming scheme to avoid clashes.  This
naming scheme becomes very verbose at times, so PEAR will start using
namespaces once they appear in PHP 5.0.  [note: the "namespace syntax"
used below is based on the current proposals on the Zend Engine 2.0
mailing list]

Now to the use-cases:

1. Programmer who is new to PEAR wants to register himself and publish his
   brand new "Money_Fast" package:
    1. applies for PEAR account
    2. gets email when account is open
    3. proceed to use-case 2

2. Programmer wants to register his new "Money_Fast" package:
    1. registers his project with the name space "Money:Fast"[1].  It
       is the programmer's responsibility to put the package in the
       right place
    2. proceed to use-case 3

3. Programmer wants to publish a new version of "Money_Fast":
    1. uploads a tgz file built with "pear package" along with a
       version number, maturity level (beta, stable etc.),
       release notes and dependencies
    2. package is now published and will appear on the "recently
       published" list on  pear.php.net, a notice goes to the
       pear-announce mailing list, freshmeat.net etc.
