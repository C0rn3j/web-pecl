                The general directory for new PEAR-classes and moduls is 
				pear/ in the CVS-repository. The name of the directory of the 
				new class is build from the class name and the package name. 
				If you wrote a class called bar as a part of the package foo, 
				the name of the directory is foo_bar. So the resulting path 
				is 	pear/foo_bar.

            <para>
                Yes. But make sure, that you mark up the experimental/ unstable
                status of the project in the documention. The best place to do 
				this is in the package.xml in the &lt;status&gt;-tag. 
				The values for this tag are 
				<simplelist>
					<member>
						<parameter>alpha</parameter> - first stages of 
						development, all things could change ( API, behavoir) 
						without advice, a lot of bugs are normal
					</member>
					<member>
						<parameter>beta</parameter> - stable API, usable 
						software, bugs are possible
					</member>
					<member>
						<parameter>devel</parameter> - a release intented for 
						developers from outside the core developers of the 
						class who want from other developers to test, give 
						feedback.
					</member>
					<member>
						<parameter>stable</parameter> - the software was tested,
						the API fixed, the documention wrote and is the 
						recommended release for users and production 
						enviroments.
					</member>
					<member>
						<parameter>cvs</parameter> - a cvs snapshot from a 
						certain date
